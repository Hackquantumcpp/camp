## Centralized Aggregate and Model of Polls (CAMP)

**CAMP is now archived for the time being. The site on which it was hosted is currently unavailable. CAMP and SnoutCount may be modified, reworked, and brought back for future elections, such as the 2026 or 2028 elections.**

**SnoutCounter is the successor to CAMP, and will be used to host any future political stats projects. Check that out [here](https://snoutcounter.works).**

CAMP is a lightweight web-based poll aggregator for the 2024 US presidential, senate, and gubernatorial elections. It displays trends and averages for both national and state-level polling. It also includes the SnoutCount model, an amateur election prediction model that aims to predict the likelihood of either candidate in the presidential election of winning the race and individual states.
