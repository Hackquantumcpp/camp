### Reasons for Banned Pollsters

Banned pollsters are pollsters who may _technically_ meet the quality and non-partisanship requirements, but are neverthless disallowed from usage in the CAMP poll aggregator (and, by proxy, the SnoutCount model) due to metehodological or other misconduct, or other concerns. The reasons for the bans of these pollsters are listed below.

- **TIPP Insights**: Banned due to manipulation of data, particularly crosstabs data, for the purpose of achieving desired results (generally advantaging Republican candidates). [See here for more.](https://xcancel.com/lxeagle17/status/1844581842034491471)
- **Rasmussen Reports**: Banned due to complete lack of transparency regarding their methodology and promotion of disinformation and pseudoscience, to the extent that 538 [has banned them](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/03/08/rasmussen-538-polling/) from their poll aggregates and models.
